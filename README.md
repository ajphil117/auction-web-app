# Auction Web Application
Using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS components the team was required to create an auction house web application similar to EBay where users could post items for auction, place bids on items, and comment/review listings.
This project included a landing page, an item details page, an item creation/update page, and a user watchlist. 
Each aspect of the web application was fully functional, including a hierarchy system where users could filter by items with either the highest bids or number of watchlists. For this project, I worked on the back-end functionality of each page with another team member.

This project taught me how to coordinate my tasks and progress with my fellow team members as we all worked on the same sections of the application.

This project was originally uploaded to Heroku, which has unfortunately since expired. It can now be accessed via the source code files.
